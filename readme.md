MUSIC PLAYER

This is a simple static music player created using pure HTML and CSS as part of my MERN stack course at Coding Ninjas.

Although the website is mostly responsive, still it has some minor issues for smaller screens and need improvements. It will be covered in updated versions.

Project has 2 pages, one for home and another for single-playlist which can be accessed by clicking on any song image/link.

For demo purpose, only one song has been added and also music player play and pause functionality at the bottom can be styled to add next, previous button along with other minor functionalities which I am going to add in next stages of the project.
