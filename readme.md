MUSIC PLAYER

This is a simple static music player created using pure HTML and CSS.

The responsivity have some issues for smaller screens and need improvements. It will be covered in updated versions.

Project has 2 pages, one for home and another for single-playlist.

Also, for demo purpose, only one song has been added and music player at the bottom can be styled to add next, previous button along with other minor functionalities which I am going to add in next stages of the project.
